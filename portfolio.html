<h1> Welcome to my Portfolio </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> Hello my name is Teju, short for Tejaswini. I am currently 16 years old... okay at least almost 16 years old. I was born on August 19th, 2002 in India. I moved to the US about two and half years old and I love it here. I have a younger brother who is 11 years old and he's very annoying but at the end of the day, we got each other's back. I've moved a lot ever since I was a kid, and you can see the table below which shows the places where I've lived and how long I've in each place.</p>

<p> I go to Brooklyn Technical High School. By far, this is the best school I've went to al my life. Besides the work stress, I really like the environment of my school. I've made a great group of friends and I guess high school life can't get better than this. Besides the waking up early part, I actually like going to school and people get weirded out when they hear that but it is all good in the hood. </p>
